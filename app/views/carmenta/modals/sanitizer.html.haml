  .information It looks like you've pasted directly from Microsoft Office!<br/><br/>Sadly though, your browser wasn't able to properly handle what you pasted.  But that's ok, I've sanitized it for you!
  %textarea{ :rows => '10', :wrap => 'off' }
  %strong You can just copy and paste the sanitized content that appears above.
