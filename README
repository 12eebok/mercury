=== Mercury Editor











== The Name

  It's sure to come up, so let's take care of it now.  Mercury is the messenger
  god of Roman mythology, so the name seemed appropriate.  When it came to logo
  ideas the element came up, which also seemed appropriate since it requires
  careful usage.

  The same seems to be true for a WYSIWYG editor, because great power should be
  weilded carefully.  It goes to the core ideals behind how the configuration
  for Mercury was designed.  You can easily remove or add aspects based on your
  needs, and how sauvy you think the people using will be.
